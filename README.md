# final_project_be434

This project aims to make my life in the lab and at the greenhouse easier. This is accomplished by allowing me to download the data from my machines and put it into this program, where it will then return brief overview of averages of certain values, as well as a nice view of what is going on with those values over time. Then I also want there to be an output containing the edited CSV file, with cleaned up headings, and in the proper format.
